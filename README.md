Hi, I'm Christopher (Chris is fine). 😁 I'm a Software Developer currently looking for my next opportunity after a career break for personal reasons. Previously I worked at [Spektrix](https://www.spektrix.com/en-gb/), developing features for the SaaS platform and playing a part in moving the software from a dataentre to the cloud platform Azure.

About Me

- 🛠️ I'm currently working through the [Cloud Resume Challenge]([https://fullstackopen.com/en/](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/)) course to brush up on my skills and become more familiar with various aspects of AWS that I haven't touched before
- 📝 What I want to learn next: Getting a better understanding of React/Vue - Frontend is one of my weaker aspects and I haven't had an opportunity to dive deep into a framework, this is something I'd like to explore in the future
- 🙋 Pronouns: he/him/they
