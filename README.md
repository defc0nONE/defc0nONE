Hi, I'm Chris. 😁 I'm a Software Developer currently looking for my next opportunity after a career break for personal reasons. Previously I worked at [Spektrix](https://www.spektrix.com/en-gb/), developing features for the SaaS platform and playing a part in moving the software from a dataentre to the cloud platform Azure.

About Me
------------

- 🛠️ I'm currently working through the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course to brush up on my skills and learn modern web technologies such as React
- 📝 What I want to learn next: Getting a better understanding of cloud engineering -  My favourite part about my previous role was the exposure of moving our infrastructure to Azure and I would like to explore that further.
